# mastermind

Create the game mastermind where a codemaker creates a secret code from 4 out of 6 colors.
The codebreaker's job is to guess the code exactly: colors and position of the colors. 

The goal is to build a mastermind game where you have 12 turns to guess the correct code. 
The codemaker and codebreaker can be either the computer or the person.
